# Customer Segmentation using K-means Clustering

## Overview

This repository contains code to perform customer segmentation using the K-means clustering algorithm. The goal is to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history, enabling targeted marketing and personalized strategies.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this analysis contains historical data of customer transactions, including customer IDs, purchase amounts, and timestamps. The dataset may also include additional features such as customer demographics or product categories.

## Dependencies

- Python 3.x
- pandas
- NumPy
- scikit-learn

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/brex19/PRODIGY_ML_02
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Prepare the dataset: Ensure that your dataset is in a suitable format for analysis, with relevant features such as customer IDs and purchase history.

2. Run the `kmeans_clustering.py` script:

    ```
    python kmeans_clustering.py
    ```

3. Adjust parameters: Modify the script as needed to customize the number of clusters (`k`) and other algorithm parameters.

4. Analyze results: Review the output of the clustering algorithm to understand the segmentation of customers and identify actionable insights for marketing strategies.

## Results

The K-means clustering algorithm segments customers into distinct groups based on their purchase history. Each group represents a unique customer segment, allowing retailers to tailor marketing campaigns and promotional offers to specific customer preferences and behaviors.
